    <h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <p class="indigotext"> This website will showcase my final project for Graphic Design 4 class. The final project was a collection book. We had to pick a collection that we owned and design a book about it. My collection was about all the various types of tea that I own and the teaware collection that my grandmother owns. I hope you enjoy looking at my collection book titled "Just My Cup Of Tea".
